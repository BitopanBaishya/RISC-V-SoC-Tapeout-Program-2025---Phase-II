# 🏛️ RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program 2025 — Phase 2

Welcome!  
This repository serves as the **master documentation hub** for **Phase 2** of my journey in the **RISC-V SoC Reference Tapeout Program 2025**. Unlike Phase 1, which followed a structured weekly documentation, this phase is significantly more **intensive and execution-focused**, and is therefore documented on a **daily basis**.

Phase 2 marks the transition from guided learning to **research oriented hands-on SoC implementation with professional tools**, where each day contributes directly toward the final tapeout. To accurately capture this pace and depth, the entire documentation is organized as **day-wise logs**, reflecting real design work, debugging cycles, and engineering decisions as they happen.

Each day of this phase typically involves:
- Deep dives into SoC design, verification, and physical implementation
- Hands-on execution using industry-grade toolflows
- Debugging design, scripts, and toolchain issues
- Documenting progress, challenges, observations, and learnings

For clarity and traceability, **each day has its own dedicated folder** within this repository, containing a `README.md` file that documents that day’s work in detail. All daily logs are indexed and linked from this master `README`, enabling easy chronological navigation or targeted reference.

This repository is intended to function as a **live engineering logbook**—structured, transparent, and reflective of real-world semiconductor workflows.

## 📌 Read Before You Start
This repository documents my progress through **Phase 2 of the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program 2025** as it unfolds. It is not meant to be a polished tutorial, but rather a practical and honest record of learning through execution.

Please keep the following in mind:
- The documentation is organized **day-wise**, mirroring the actual timeline of the program.
- Some days may focus more on debugging and analysis than visible progress.
- Suggestions, corrections, and discussions are always welcome.
- If you find this repository helpful, consider sharing it with others pursuing similar work.
